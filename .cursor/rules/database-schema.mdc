# Database Schema Overview

The application uses Prisma with a PostgreSQL database. The schema is defined in `[prisma/schema.prisma](mdc:prisma/schema.prisma)`.

## Primary Key Strategy

-   All models use an auto-incrementing `Int` as their primary key (`id`), with the exception of the `Session` model.
-   The `Session` model's `id` is a `String` that is managed by the Shopify App Remix library.
